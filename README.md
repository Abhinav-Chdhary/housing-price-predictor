# housing-price-predictor ðŸ˜Ž
To make a basic ai that predicts housing price with react frontend. 
## Technologies used:
Flask for backend
Python/Jupyter notebook to make the model

React-Chakra.ui for frontend

### New things I learnt for this project
- How to use predefined libraries like Chakra.ui
- How to create a backend with flask
- How to package and deploy a machine learning model for a web app ...etc

## Future Work:
1. The model's accuracy needs to be increased.
2. For now it only works for carlifornia housing dataset, however I it to predict median housing price anywhere in the world.
3. Better UI/UX
4. Proofing against intentional bad values.
